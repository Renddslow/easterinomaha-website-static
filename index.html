					<h2>A Sunday for Your Whole Family</h2>
					<p class="info">We've designed this weekend to help your entire family experience the story of Easter in a brand new way. From start to finish you will be left feeling the power of God's love and the impact of Christ's sacrifice. <a href="#about-flatland">Hosted by Flatland Church</a></p>
					<p class="info">Listen, we know how scary it can be to walk into a new church for the first time. That's why we want to make you feel as comfortable as possible. You won't be met with guilt, shame, or condemnation. And we don't care how you're dressed or what candidate you voted for.</p>
